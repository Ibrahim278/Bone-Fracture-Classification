# Bone-Fracture-Classification

Here we attempt to create an algorithm to classify images for bone fracture, for this an input image is given and output is given as a “Positive” or “Negative” label. The input data is in the form of X Ray images of the bones. Hence, an appropriate supervised learning model is to be trained with the data to give correct label to the input image to predict a fracture. Some preprocessing of the data (converting RGB images to Grayscale) is also necessary here. This repository contains a Keras implementation of a 169 layer Densenet Model on MURA dataset
